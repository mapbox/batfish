# Static files deployed to URLs

-   Places non-page files within the pages directory in order to deploy them to specific URLs.
    Then uses those files within pages.
-   Uses the [`unprocessedPageFiles`] configuration option to cause a file that would otherwise be processed as a page to be treated as another static file.

[`unprocessedpagefiles`]: ../../docs/configuration.md#unprocessedpagefiles

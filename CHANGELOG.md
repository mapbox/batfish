# Changelog

## Head

- [Add] Enable page-specific CSS.
  See ["Page-specific CSS" documentation](docs/advanced-usage.md#page-specific-css).

## 0.10.4

- [Fix] Restructure directories to be more friendly for Flow-using consumers.

## 0.10.3

- [Fix] Don't hijack links that aren't to Batfish routes.
  Refactoring in 0.10.0 introduced this bug.

## 0.10.2

- [Fix] Include more files in npm package ...

## 0.10.1

- [Fix] Include `dist/` in npm package. Oops.

## 0.10.0

- **[Breaking change]** Require Node 6. (Drop support for Node 4.)
- **[Breaking change]** Remove `staticDirectory` option.
  The same effect can be accomplished by putting static files in the pages directory.
- **[Breaking change]** `with-location` now provides the original component at WrappedComponent instead of WrapperComponent.
- **[Breaking change]** change `data-no-hijack` attribute name to `data-batfish-no-hijack`.
  Also, this attribute now blocks link hijacking on the element itself _and all its children_.
- **[Breaking change]** (maybe, maybe not) Links with fragment URLs (e.g. `href="#foo"`) are not hijacked, just left to their default behavior.  
- [Add] Much improved logging!  
- [Add] Much improved configuration validation!  
- [Add] Much improved error handling!  
- [Add] `hijackLinks` configuration option, defaulting to `true`.
- [Add] Improve `prefixUrl` to work with already-prefixed URLs and absolute URLs.
- [Add] Add `unprocessedPageFiles` option.
- [Add] Include `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties` by default.
- [Add] `start` now rebuilds when you change a page's front matter, create a new page, or delete a page.
- [Fix] Update postcss-html-filter to fix bugs inlining CSS with certain pseudo selectors.

## 0.9.4

- [Fix] Do not rebase URLs in CSS that have protocols.

## 0.9.2

- [Fix] Fix the url-referenced assets in CSS are copied and rebased for the static build.
- [Fix] Ensure that the user's versions of react, react-dom, and react-helmet are used.

## 0.9.1

- [Fix] Assets referenced by `url()` in CSS you include with the `stylesheets` option are copied into the `outputDirectory`.

## 0.9.0

- **[Breaking change]** Revised `dataSelectors` system.
  Values returned by `dataSelectors` can now be used by `import`ing modules from `@mapbox/batfish/data/[data-selector-name]`, instead of using the special `injectedData` front matter property.
  For example, the return value from the `dataSelectors.watchOutForBees` is available with `import beeData from '@mapbox/batfish/data/watch-out-for-bees';`.

## 0.8.0

- [Addition] `includePromisePolyfill` configuration option.
- [Fix] Batfish will inject its specified version of `es6-promise` even if something about your dependency resolution ends up putting an older version of that polyfill at `node_modules/es6-promise`.

## 0.7.0

- **[Breaking change]** Renamed `externalStylesheets` option to `stylesheets`.
- **[Breaking change]** CSS is no longer `import`ed or `require`d via Webpack.
  All stylesheets should be listed in the `stylesheets` configuration array.
- **[Breaking change]** Renamed `wrapperPath` option to `applicationWrapperPath`.
- **[Breaking change]** Removed `notFoundPath` option.
  Instead, 404 pages always live as `404.(js|md)` in the `pagesDirectory`.
- **[Breaking change]** 404 pages are no longer `index.html` files inside directories, e.g. `404/index.html`.
  They are just HTML pages, e.g. `404.html`.
- **[Breaking change]** Changed default `outputDirectory` from `_site` to `_batfish_site`.
- **[Breaking change]** Changed default `temporaryDirectory` from `_tmp` to `_batfish_tmp`.
- **[Breaking change]** Upgrade jsxtreme-markdown, which changed `modules` front matter property in Markdown pages to `prependJs`.

## 0.6.0

- [Addition] `webpackStaticIgnore` configuration option.
- [Fix] Links with fragment identifiers.
  Only scroll to the top of the page after the URL changes if the location's pathname changes and if there is no fragment identifier in the URL.
- [Fix] Use ES2015 named imports for default `modules` values in `jsxtreme-markdown` documents.

## 0.5.0

- Changed `batfish/md` path, for Babel-compiled Markdown in JS pages, to `@mapbox/batfish/modules/md`.
- Switched ES2015 module compilation from Webpack's system to Babel's ES2015 preset.
- Use [worker-farm](https://github.com/rvagg/node-worker-farm) for inlining CSS in static HTML files.
- Upgrade Webpack to v3.
- Use external [@mapbox/link-to-location](https://github.com/mapbox/link-to-location) package, delete local version.
- Put BrowserSync in `offline` mode.
- Upgrade jsxtreme-markdown to get some bug fixes.

## 0.4.0

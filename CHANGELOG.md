# Changelog

## Head

- **Fix:** Fix undefined Promise in IE 11 by adding core-js (es.promise and es.array.iterator) to the Webpack config `entry`.

## 1.10.0

- Upgrade Webpack to v4.

## 1.9.8

- **Fix:** Fix bug that caused `.json` files in the `pagesDirectory` *not* to be copied to the `outputDirectory`.
- **Fix:** Fix bug that caused *some* `unprocessedPageFiles` to *sometimes* be processed as pages.

## 1.9.7

- **Fix:** Fix Node 10 compatibility by updating `cpy` dependency.
- **Fix:** Update dependencies.

## 1.9.6

- **Deprecate:** Add a deprecation warning when using the `spa` mode.

## 1.9.5

- **Fix:** Remove `^` from `assets-webpack-plugin` dependency to avoid regression.

## 1.9.4

- **Fix:** Use `webpackPlugins` in static HTML build as well as client-side bundle build, as plugins like `DefinePlugin` can provide information that is depended on for building the HTML. *If this breaks a build for you, please open an issue about your use case.*

## 1.9.3

- **Fix:** Add `electron` to list of libraries that Webpack should *not* try to bundle during the HTML build.

## 1.9.2

- **Fix:** Remove production usage of Prettier. Generated files will not be as pretty, but it's worth removing the large dependency and complications it can introduce.

## 1.9.1

- **Fix:** Fix custom 404 pages on sites with a `siteBasePath`.

## 1.9.0

- **Feature:** Added a helpful message if the provided port is not available.
- **Feature:** Files reference as URLs in CSS then copied into the output directory (via postcss-url) now include the file's original basename as well as the hash.
- **Feature:** Expose Batfish's version of Webpack on `require('@mapbox/batfish').webpack`, so it can be used for custom plugin configuration.
- **Fix:** Prevent batfish from entering an unpredictable state if provided port is unavailable.

## 1.8.2

- **Fix** Change the CLI parameter `-p/--port` to accept number data type.

## 1.8.1

- Update jsxtreme-markdown packages, which use a new processing pipeline.

## 1.8.0

- **Add:** Automatically add data about headings to front matter of Markdown pages and `id` attributes to the heading elements.
  The headings data can be used to generate a table of contents in the Markdown page wrapper component, as illustrated in the table-of-contents example.
  (This feature was added to jsxtreme-markdown.)
- Chore: Unobtrusive dependency updates.

## 1.7.5

- **Fix:** Prevent new default 404 page from breaking SPA mode.

## 1.7.4

- **Fix:** Add `babel-core` to `dependencies`, since it's a peer dependency of `babel-loader`.

## 1.7.3

- **Fix:** Replace code that caused Webpack warning about `Chunk.modules` being deprecated.

## 1.7.2

- **Add:** Improve logging by adding approximate times for build phases.
- **Add:** Helpful default 404 page (in development mode only).
- **Fix:** If you provide an `applicationWrapper` in `spa` mode, it will be included in the static HTML build.
- **Fix:** Update postcss-html-filter for CSS-inlining bug fix.

## 1.6.2

- **Fix:** Add several packages to `dependencies` which were mistakingly added to `devDependencies`.

## 1.6.1

- Chore: Swap out development servers. This should reduce dependency weight and complexity and fix an infrequent bug where `start` crashed when it tried to print the local URL.

## 1.6.0

- **Add:** Add `sitemap` option, allowing user to turn off sitemap generation.
- **Fix:** Improve error messages when front matter parsing fails.

## 1.5.1

- Remove webpack-chunk-hash dependency. Recent versions of Webpack do not require this module for deterministic filename hashing.

## 1.5.0

- **Add:** Add `staticHtmlInlineDeferCss` option.

## 1.4.0

- **Add:** Add `webpackStaticStubReactComponent` option.
- **Add:** Use Webpack's `node` option in the client config to stub core Node libraries, resulting in fewer errors buried in users' dependencies.

## 1.3.0

- **Add:** Add `devBrowserslist` option. **This will change the browser support of your development (not production) build.**
- **Add:** Add `-b, --browsers` option for `batfish start`.
- **Add:** `browserslist` and `devBrowserslist` affect babel-preset-env, not just Autoprefixer.

## 1.2.0

- **Add:** Include `babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread` by default.
- **Add:** Add `manageScrollRestoration` option.
- **Add:** Add **experimental** `spa` option.
  This option might suffer breaking changes on any release until it's no longer "experimental".

## 1.1.0

- **Add:** `-i, --include` option to `batfish start` command, and corresponding `includePages` configuration option, which allows you to speed up your development build by only building the specified pages.
- **Add:** `batfish write-bablerc` command (`batfish.writeBabelrc` in Node API), which writes a `.babelrc` file that you can use to tell other process, like a test runner, how to interpret your source files.
- **Add:** Add `babelInclude` option.
- **Fix:** Fix bug that could cause builds with unnamed dynamic imports to fail with a cryptic error about a hash-based filename that is too long.
- **Fix:** Actually exclude `node_modules` from Babel compilation, as intended and documented.
  **Warning:** this fix makes the functionality fit the documented public API, but if you were accidentally relying on a `node_module` being accidentally compiled, this could break your build.
  You'll want to use the new `babelInclude` option to indicate those `node_modules` that need to be compiled.
- **Fix:** Tweak default `babelExclude` value to ensure it excludes nested `node_modules` directories.
- **Chore:** Remove json-loader, which Webpack no longer needs to import JSON.
- **Chore:** Allow babel-loader to use its default cache location (`node_modules/.cache/babel-loader`).

## 1.0.4

- **Fix:** Fix bug causing build to fail if you used `npm link` (or `yarn link`), with a message about failing to find Babel plugins.

## 1.0.3

- Upgrade dependencies. There should not be any user-faces changes, just behind-the-scenes improvements.

## 1.0.2

- **Fix:** Fix bug where changes to recent versions of BrowserSync broke server initialization logging.

## 1.0.1

- **Fix:** Upgrade `@mapbox/jsxtreme-markdown-loader` to get bug fix related to determining Markdown wrappers with a `getWrapper` function.

## 1.0.0

- No changes. Releasing 1.0 because the library has been stable enough that 1.0 will be good for semver.

## 0.13.4

- **Fix:** Use `NamedChunksPlugin` to improve long-term caching.

## 0.13.3

- **Fix:** Do not copy files specified by `unprocessedPageFiles` option if they are also ignored by `ignoreWithinPagesDirectory`.
- **Fix:** Fix bug that caused the static build's Webpack config to look for certain dependencies, like `uglify-js`, in the wrong place.
- **Fix:** Better errors for obscure parse errors from compiled `static-render-pages.js`.

## 0.13.2

- **Fix:** `outputDirectory` and `temporaryDirectory` do not have to exist as part of config validation.

## 0.13.1

- **Fix:** Add Prettier to `dependencies`, not just `devDependencies`.
- **Fix:** Provide more clear error messages by checking for the existing of files or directories while validating configuration for the following options: `applicationWrapperPath`, `pagesDirectory`, `outputDirectory`, `temporaryDirectory`, `inlineJs`.
- **Fix:** Fix buggy validation of `inlineJs` configuration property.

## 0.13.0

## 0.11.3

- **Fix:** Fragments in the URL take precedence over saved scroll positions in the history.

## 0.11.2

- **Fix:** Development server does not quit the process when there are Webpack compilation errors.
  Instead, you can just fix them and rebuild.

## 0.11.1

- **Fix:** Remove imports of `batfish-internal/context` from public modules.
  These break unit tests, or any other reference to the file outside of Batfish's builds.

## 0.11.0

- **Add:** Add `babelPresetEnvOptions` option.
- **Add:** Enable page-specific CSS.
  See ["Page-specific CSS" documentation](docs/advanced-usage.md#page-specific-css).

## 0.10.4

- **Fix:** Restructure directories to be more friendly for Flow-using consumers.

## 0.10.3

  Also, this attribute now blocks link hijacking on the element itself *and all its children*.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** (maybe, maybe not) Links with fragment URLs (e.g. `href="#foo"`) are not hijacked, just left to their default behavior.
- **Add:** Much improved logging!
- **Add:** Much improved configuration validation!

- **Fix:** Assets referenced by `url()` in CSS you include with the `stylesheets` option are copied into the `outputDirectory`.

## 0.9.0

- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** Revised `dataSelectors` system.
  Values returned by `dataSelectors` can now be used by `import`ing modules from `@mapbox/batfish/data/[data-selector-name]`, instead of using the special `injectedData` front matter property.
  For example, the return value from the `dataSelectors.watchOutForBees` is available with `import beeData from '@mapbox/batfish/data/watch-out-for-bees';`.

## 0.8.0

- **Addition:** `includePromisePolyfill` configuration option.
- **Fix:** Batfish will inject its specified version of `es6-promise` even if something about your dependency resolution ends up putting an older version of that polyfill at `node_modules/es6-promise`.

## 0.7.0

- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** Renamed `externalStylesheets` option to `stylesheets`.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** CSS is no longer `import`ed or `require`d via Webpack.
  All stylesheets should be listed in the `stylesheets` configuration array.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** Renamed `wrapperPath` option to `applicationWrapperPath`.
- ðŸš¨ **Breaking change:** Removed `notFoundPath` option.
  Instead, 404 pages always live as `404.(js|md)` in the `pagesDirectory`.

- **Fix:** Links with fragment identifiers.
  Only scroll to the top of the page after the URL changes if the location's pathname changes and if there is no fragment identifier in the URL.
- **Fix:** Use ES2015 named imports for default `modules` values in `jsxtreme-markdown` documents.

## 0.5.0
